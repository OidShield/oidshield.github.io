    <h1>OidShield ‚Äì Life-Saving Wearable Technology</h1>
    <p><strong>üö® A device that can save lives when no one else is around.</strong></p>

    <h2>About OidShield</h2>
    <p>OidShield is a pioneering harm reduction technology startup focused on saving lives during opioid overdose emergencies. Our mission is to deliver a wearable, open-source medical device that automatically detects a flatline in heart activity and administers naloxone (Narcan) without the need for a bystander. This ensures that even solitary overdoses‚Äîone of the leading causes of preventable death in the opioid epidemic‚Äîcan be reversed quickly and effectively.</p>

    <p>Combining advanced biosignal monitoring, real-time ECG processing, and a proprietary actuator that triggers nasal naloxone delivery, OidShield is building the first truly autonomous overdose intervention device. The system is designed to be low-cost, open-access, and field-deployable for high-risk populations including individuals experiencing homelessness, post-incarceration transition, or living in isolation.</p>

    <p>Founded by Brandon Norman and advised by a medical student with clinical overdose response training and a senior software architect, OidShield bridges the gap between public health need and wearable innovation. We are currently preparing our SBIR Phase I application with NIH/NIDA and will be engaging public safety and harm reduction partners in field trials beginning in 2025.</p>

    <h2>What We‚Äôre Building</h2>
    <p>OidShield is a wearable device that detects flatlines in real-time and automatically administers a dose of naloxone (Narcan) to reverse opioid overdoses ‚Äî without the need for a bystander. Using biosignal monitoring, open-source hardware, and intranasal delivery, our system provides autonomous emergency response.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Over 100,000 people die from opioid overdoses in the U.S. each year, and many of them die alone. OidShield aims to change that by bringing automatic overdose reversal to the people who need it most.</p>

    <h2>Our Ask</h2>
    <p>We‚Äôre raising support to fund legal incorporation, regulatory preparation, and early hardware prototyping. Your contribution helps make OidShield real.</p>

<h2>Patent & Legal Development</h2>
<p>OidShield has initiated its patent protection process through the California Inventors Assistance Program (CIAP), managed by California Lawyers for the Arts. We are currently completing intake for pro bono support to file a provisional patent covering our autonomous overdose intervention system.</p>

<p>The invention ‚Äî a wearable device that detects flatline ECG signals and administers intranasal naloxone without bystander intervention ‚Äî is novel, life-saving, and highly relevant to underserved populations affected by opioid use disorder. Legal representation through CIAP will help OidShield secure early IP protection as we progress toward clinical prototyping and investor readiness.</p>
<p><h2>Kiva Crowdfunding Strategy</h2></p>
<p>To successfully fund my Kiva loan, I will reach out to my immediate network of family, friends, and supporters who are passionate about harm reduction and public health. I will share the loan link via social media, email, local recovery groups, and overdose prevention communities. During the Private Fundraising Period, I‚Äôll personally invite 5‚Äì50 trusted contacts, including my brothers and local allies, to be the first to lend and build early momentum. I will keep promoting the campaign with regular updates, visual storytelling, and outreach to harm reduction networks to ensure the loan is fully funded.</p>
